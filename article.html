      <h1>The Ultimate Guide to Prime Rib</h1>
      <h2>by <span>Susan Miller</span></h2>
      <h3>
        Everything you ever wanted to know about prime rib: what it is, how to
        buy the best one, and how to cook a prime rib perfectly, every time.
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is nothing more impressive than a slow roasted, deeply crusted,
        perfectly cooked prime rib landing squarely in the center of a full
        dinner table. Prime rib might be the perfect cut of beef. It’s got a
        little something for everyone. Intense well-marbled fat forward hits for
        the fat-is-flavor stans (that’s me). Supple, rosy tender parts for the
        filet/tenderloin fans. Savory beefiness in bulk for the ribeye-is-king
        crowd. And, last but not least, a deep dark crust for those guys who
        need to insert Maillard reaction into any conversation involving beef.
        Prime rib’s reputation has taken a hit in recent decades, but as always,
        the old ways are the best way. Prime rib is not only the tastiest cut of
        beef you can buy, it’s also one of the cheapest. In this ultimate guide
        to prime rib, I want to convince you to bring prime rib roasts back into
        your life, all year round, at home where it’s best.
